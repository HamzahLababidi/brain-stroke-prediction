# brain-stroke-prediction

This is my solution for predicting brain strokes, to help preventing or taking precautions against brain stroke using a dataset that contains the needed details that are a big factor in the chance of getting a brain stroke. My solution included minimal feature engineering, undersampling to balance data rows of patients that had a brain stroke occur and data rows of patients that did not have a brain stroke. Also included blending CatBoost, XGBoost and LogisticRegression models to aquire the higheset F1-Score of 98%.
